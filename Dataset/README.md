# OpinioBank

OpinioBankâ€”a large-scale, high-quality dataset designed to support user-centric opinion summarization from extensive long-form reviews (e.g., OpinioRAG). Unlike existing datasets focused on short-form reviews or synthetic review-summary pairs, OpinioBank comprises entities with over a thousand user reviews each, meticulously paired with unbiased expert reviews and manually annotated queries. This dataset serves as the first benchmark of its kind, aimed at advancing model development and evaluation for user-centric opinion summarization over large-scale, noisy, repetitive, and stylistically diverse inputs. For more details, please refer to our paper, titled ["OpinioRAG: Towards Generating User-Centric Opinion Highlights from Large-scale Online Reviews"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00285), published at COLM 2025.
